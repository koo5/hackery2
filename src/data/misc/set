One could alternatively define _<_ as a relation: it would
take in two natural numbers and return a Set. But then less-than could not be used
computationally in code. Expressions which have type Set describe code, but they are
not code themselves (one cannot pattern-match, for example, on expressions of type
Set, nor do anything else computational with them).

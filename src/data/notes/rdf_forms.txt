		buggy, can't even load a file
		many cool features: "We are planning to support syntax highlighted entry of SHACL Shapes in the next release (in addition to forms, etc.)."
		seems to be heavily aimed at editing ontologies in exactly-shaped forms rather than at working with arbitrary rdf data (can't even paste our data in)

		SHACL

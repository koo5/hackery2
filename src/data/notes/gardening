# food safe materials

ABS?

PLA?
	Despite their research findings, JMU warns of the dangers of PLA, which can be contaminated by hot ends of 3D printers. The potent mix of chemicals and heat used when printing and processing PLA pose a health danger. In addition, the coloring in PLA signifies the presence of an additive that is not food safe. Another concern is that PLA 3D printed materials have tiny holes and cracks that can accommodate harmful germs and bacteria.
	JMU concludes that PLA may only be safe when used one time or for simple things like water. However, repetitive use may cause health concerns.

At Aqua Gardening, we focus on Plastic type #2 (food safe) for use in Aquaponics, and Plastic type #2 or #5 for hydroponics. Generally, there is more exposure of Aquaponics systems to UV light and damage from the weather, so these systems must be safe even after they are damaged and scratched. On the other hand, most Hydroponic systems are located indoors or inside greenhouses, so they are generally more protected from the elements and do not get exposed to as much UV. Saying that, all of our NFT channels are made using #2 Food Safe plastic as the majority are exposed to the sun. Many customers favour the saving which come choosing #5 over the food grade #2.

BPA-free unfortunately doesn't mean anything because they just put BPB in there instead
in general, the toxicity comes from the softeners, so, the harder the plastic, the better, probably

	i did this with a CU stranded wire and there was a lot of oxidation after a few weeks, so it stopped working, but still managed to sprout one batch.

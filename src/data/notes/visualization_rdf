            allegro graph + gruff:
                form-based editing, graph navigation, would be more useful if it understood rdf lists, but definitely has some merit

                "Vitro is a general-purpose web-based ontology and instance editor with customizable public browsing. "

            https://sinopia.io
                editor, requires registration
                has a system of editable form templates
                probably only browsing strictly by these templates
            OSDE - The OpenLink Structured Data Editor
                http://osde.openlinksw.com/
                simple table-of-triples-based rdf editor, virtuoso-integrated
            http://en.lodlive.it/
                just "sparql explorer"/visualization or not useful for working with own data
            https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms
                model driven form-based editing, useful as a framework for making rdf-stored data editable to users

                https://www.topquadrant.com/topbraid-composer-install/
                    buggy, can't even load a file
                    many cool features: "We are planning to support syntax highlighted entry of SHACL Shapes in the next release (in addition to forms, etc.)."
                    seems to be heavily aimed at editing ontologies in exactly-shaped forms rather than at working with arbitrary rdf data (can't even paste our data in)

pretty-print n3:
	* use pure rdflib instead of cwm, see ../python/rdf_cleanup2.n3
	* make sure list nodes don't appear in extra triples, and are well-formed
	* if you want something nested, it must be a bnode

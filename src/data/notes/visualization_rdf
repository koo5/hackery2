                form-based editing, graph navigation, would be more useful if it understood rdf lists, but definitely has some merit

                many cool features: "We are planning to support syntax highlighted entry of SHACL Shapes in the next release (in addition to forms, etc.)."
                seems to be heavily aimed at editing ontologies in exactly-shaped forms rather than at working with arbitrary rdf data (can't even paste our data in)

				special presentation of lists, with graphviz nested nodes
				non-default graphs, graph properties, with graphviz nested graphs
			but in the end, without interactivity, it's always gonna have limited usefulness

            - https://github.com/koo5/hackery2/blob/master/src/data/rdf_order/rdf_cleanup2.py
            - use pure rdflib instead of cwm, rdflib is maintained
            - make sure list nodes don't appear in extra triples, and are well-formed
            - if you want something nested, it must be a bnode

        other tools:
            cwm:
                better to avoid in the beginning and use just rdflib, which is still maintained

                    stardog
                        - virtual graphs, but only in paid version
                        - owl inference with explanations
                        - quite nice
                    allegro (+ gruff)
                        - nice
            okay
                virtuoso
                    URLBurner.
                        could be used like this:
                            create a django service to be accessed through a bookmarklet.
                            service first submits a page to uriburner, then makes a request to add "x a bookmark; byUser koo"
                            export from virtuoso, edit in protege?
                            could be used to build a bookrmarking solution, but isn't one, thus far

mind-mapping:

    an issue with all of them so for is a lack of automatic layouting for "non-primary" connections, ie, nodes are layouted by their "part-of" relationship, and you can choose different presentations of that, or move a child node into different slots of the parent node, but once you add a "custom" relation, you have to position it yourself. But we could tackle that.

    ordered from most promising to least

        freeplane
            seems to have a more freeform attitude, yet still keyboard friendly.
            i can definitely imagine this used for exploring rdf-based data (or a high-level, possibly domain-specific export of them)

            rdf import, somewhat usable, but skips nodes
            "build sitemap"
            "watch clipboard"



        https://www.thebrain.com/
            maybe useful for some creative mindmapping, but the navigation doesn't seem suited for factual work?

        "XMind: ZEN 2020"
            keyboard based navigation between nodes, so far the closest to what i'd want in a rdf viewer
            implicit "is-part-of" relation, other relations possible but not keyboard navigable

            open source(?..)

        "XMind 8 Pro"
            open-source(?..)

        https://mind42.com/
            basic, browser based, not sure if it supports "custom" links

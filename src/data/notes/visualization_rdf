rdf:
	explore,visualize,edit,manage
		note:
			there is kind of a continuum starting from dealing with bare triples:
				strictly: management of graph and rdf-based data in a generic way
					Just nodes and edges:
						sw that deals with graphs in the mathematical sense, mostly represented by tools for "property graph" databases, ie, neo4j. Rdf is more expressive and can map to this only partially.
					sw aware of contexts(graphs):
						for example gruff.
					sw that includes special functionality for managing rdf lists (still in a non-domain-specific way).
						none found yet, but not so hard to add implement
					less common/new idioms:
						dealing with properties of graphs / properties of triples intelligently, understanding nested graphs/contexts
				less strictly:
					sw for managing domain-specific data, where rdf is largely just a storage mechanism, "templating systems".
				even less strictly, could be said: starting from freeform text, progressively adding stronger semantics, and not losing the implicit information hidden in the form...

				how to export into it:
					we need to do it in a streaming fashion:

					pyyed:
						chokes on 1000+ triples
					best to save our stuff as graphml, that's a xml format comparable to graphviz's.
					https://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/file_details/graphml/prolog/graphml_ugraph.pl is no use because it only uses "ugraphs", undirected graphs
					maybe use networkx in python?

					many cool features: "We are planning to support syntax highlighted entry of SHACL Shapes in the next release (in addition to forms, etc.)."

						rdf import, somewhat usable, but skips nodes
						"build sitemap"
						"watch clipboard"

					https://www.thebrain.com/
						maybe useful for some creative mindmapping, but the navigation doesn't seem suited for factual work?

					"XMind: ZEN 2020"
						keyboard based navigation between nodes, so far the closest to what i'd want in a rdf viewer
						implicit "is-part-of" relation, other relations possible but not keyboard navigable

						"open source"(?..)

					"XMind 8 Pro"
						"open-source"(?..)

					https://mind42.com/
						basic, browser based, not sure if it supports "custom" links

					vym
						no "custom" links, even in latest version
						Qt (probably snappier than java)

					note
						an issue with all of them so for is a lack of automatic layouting for "non-primary" connections, ie, nodes are layouted by their "part-of" relationship, and you can choose different presentations of that, or move a child node into different slots of the parent node, but once you add a "custom" relation, you have to position it yourself. But we could tackle that.

		- use pure rdflib instead of cwm, rdflib is maintained

		- if you want something nested, it must be a bnode
		https://github.com/AKSW/Xturtle

		"""n this case study we used Karma to convert records of 44,000 of the museum’s holdings to Linked Open Data according to the Europeana Data Model (EDM). The records are stored in several tables in a SQL Server database. Using Karma we modeled these tables in terms of the EDM ontology and converted the data into RDF. We are creating a 5-star Linked Data, linked to DBpedia, the Getty Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)® and the NY Times Linked Data."""

 rdf:
    explore,visualize,edit,manage

        note:
            there is kind of a continuum from dealing with bare triples to dealing with domain-specific data:
                strictly: management of rdf-based data in a generic way
                    i would further categorize:
                        Just nodes and edges:
                            sw that deals with graphs in the mathematical sense, mostly represented by tools for "property graph" databases, ie, neo4j. Rdf is more expressive and can map to this only partially.
                        sw aware of contexts(graphs):
                            for example gruff.
                less strictly:
                    sw that includes special functionality for managing rdf lists (still in a non-domain-specific way). Rdf lists are a common idiom.
                        none found yet, but not so hard to add implement
                    less common/new idioms:
                        dealing with properties of graphs / properties of triples intelligently, understanding nested graphs/contexts
                even less strictly:
                    sw for managing domain-specific data, where rdf is largely just a storage mechanism. These are the "templating systems".

                    note
                        an issue with all of them so for is a lack of automatic layouting for "non-primary" connections, ie, nodes are layouted by their "part-of" relationship, and you can choose different presentations of that, or move a child node into different slots of the parent node, but once you add a "custom" relation, you have to position it yourself. But we could tackle that.

                        many import formats
                        rdf import, somewhat usable, but skips nodes
                        "build sitemap"
                        "watch clipboard"

                        maybe useful for some creative mindmapping, but the navigation doesn't seem suited for factual work?

                    "XMind: ZEN 2020"
                        keyboard based navigation between nodes, so far the closest to what i'd want in a rdf viewer
                        implicit "is-part-of" relation, other relations possible but not keyboard navigable

                        "open source"(?..)

                    "XMind 8 Pro"
                        "open-source"(?..)

                    https://mind42.com/
                        basic, browser based, not sure if it supports "custom" links

                    vym
                        no "custom" links, even in latest version
                        Qt (probably snappier than java)


    pretty-print:
        - https://github.com/koo5/hackery2/blob/master/src/data/rdf_order/rdf_cleanup2.py
        - use pure rdflib instead of cwm, rdflib is maintained
        - make sure list nodes don't appear in extra triples, and are well-formed
        - if you want something nested, it must be a bnode

    other tools:
        cwm:
            better to avoid in the beginning and use just rdflib, which is still maintained
            `python2 ~/sw/dev/swap/cwm.py --n3 lodgeitrequest.n3  --rdf > rdf.rdf`
        http://librdf.org/raptor/ - rapper cli tool is useful for format conversions


    triplestores:
        not so excited about:
            blazegraph
                crashes, ooms, poor performance (in my tests)
        cool ones found so far:
                stardog
                    - virtual graphs, but only in paid version
                    - owl inference with explanations
                    - quite nice
                allegro (+ gruff)
                    - nice
        okay
            virtuoso
                URLBurner.
                    could be used like this:
                        create a django service to be accessed through a bookmarklet.
                        service first submits a page to uriburner, then makes a request to add "x a bookmark; byUser koo"
                        export from virtuoso, edit in protege?
                        could be used to build a bookrmarking solution, but isn't one, thus far

        experimental:
            dunno:
                https://github.com/Merck/Halyard

        important factors:
            automatic rest api:

            sql interface for nlsql:
                neptune
                anzo

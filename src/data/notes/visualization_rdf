			nice, somewhat useful. Could add logic for:
				special presentation of lists, with graphviz nested nodes
				non-default graphs, graph properties, with graphviz nested graphs
			but in the end, without interactivity, it's always gonna have limited usefulness



		js-based would be ideal.

                form-based editing, graph navigation, would be more useful if it understood rdf lists, but definitely has some merit

                editor, requires registration
                has a system of editable form templates
                probably only browsing strictly by these templates

                just "sparql explorer"/visualization or not useful for working with own data

            https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms
                model driven form-based editing, useful as a framework for making rdf-stored data editable to users

                    buggy, can't even load a file
                    many cool features: "We are planning to support syntax highlighted entry of SHACL Shapes in the next release (in addition to forms, etc.)."
                    seems to be heavily aimed at editing ontologies in exactly-shaped forms rather than at working with arbitrary rdf data (can't even paste our data in)

pretty-print n3:
	* use pure rdflib instead of cwm, see for formatting our n3 files: https://github.com/koo5/hackery2/blob/master/src/data/rdf_order/rdf_cleanup2.py
	* make sure list nodes don't appear in extra triples, and are well-formed
	* if you want something nested, it must be a bnode

	
other tools:
	cwm: better to avoid in the beginning and use just rdflib, which keeps being developed.
	http://librdf.org/raptor/ - rapper cli tool is useful for format conversions

       allegro graph + gruff:
                form-based editing, graph navigation, would be more useful if it understood rdf lists, but definitely has some merit

        TBCME/TBCSE/TBCFE
            https://www.topquadrant.com/topbraid-composer-install/
                buggy, can't even load a file
                many cool features: "We are planning to support syntax highlighted entry of SHACL Shapes in the next release (in addition to forms, etc.)."
                seems to be heavily aimed at editing ontologies in exactly-shaped forms rather than at working with arbitrary rdf data (can't even paste our data in)

        https://github.com/koo5/ontology-visualization
			nice simple picture generator, somewhat useful. Could add logic for:
				special presentation of lists, with graphviz nested nodes
				non-default graphs, graph properties, with graphviz nested graphs
			but in the end, without interactivity, it's always gonna have limited usefulness

            works, could have some use, somewhat confusing

            editor, requires registration
            has a system of editable form templates
            probably only browsing strictly by these templates

            model driven form-based editing, useful as a framework for making rdf-stored data editable to users

            will be inherently limited by not being able to follow properties of graphs. But then, what existing rdf tool wont?
            it should be useful enough for letting users produce data

        https://www.d3web.de/Wiki.jsp?page=D3web-Core
            didnt run? should try it again

    browser-based would be ideal

            didnt find anything rdf related, but i guess it would be a reasonable engine for building something



pretty-print:
    - https://github.com/koo5/hackery2/blob/master/src/data/rdf_order/rdf_cleanup2.py
	- use pure rdflib instead of cwm, rdflib is maintained
	- make sure list nodes don't appear in extra triples, and are well-formed
	- if you want something nested, it must be a bnode


other tools:
	cwm: better to avoid in the beginning and use just rdflib, which keeps being developed.
	http://librdf.org/raptor/ - rapper cli tool is useful for format conversions





triplestores:
    not so excited about:
        blazegraph
            crashes
    cool ones found so far:
            stardog
                - virtual graphs, but only in paid version
                - owl inference with explanations
                - quite nice
            allegro (+ gruff)
                - nice
    okay
        virtuoso
            URLBurner.
                could be used like this:
                    create a django service to be accessed through a bookmarklet.
                    service first submits a page to uriburner, then makes a request to add "x a bookmark; byUser koo"
                    export from virtuoso, edit in protege?
                    could be used to build a bookrmarking solution, but isn't one, thus far

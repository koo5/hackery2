..or rather, don't treat attributes and child elements differently on the parser api level.
so, err, attributes can't contain structured data. Their main purpose seems to be hiding text, so you should just use a special-purpose tag for that:

```
<what>barbecue</what> on
<span
    property="cal:dtstart"
    content="2007-09-16T16:00:00-05:00"
    datatype="xsd:dateTime"
>
    September 16th at 4pm
</span>.
```
becomes:
```
<what>barbecue</what> on
<span>
    <hidden>
        <property>cal:dtstart</property>
        <content>2007-09-16T16:00:00-05:00</content>
        <datatype>xsd:dateTime</datatype>
    </hidden>
    September 16th at 4pm
</span>.
```

but ofc, the question "hidden from what" begs itself.

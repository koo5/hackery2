no luck with xfce:
```
  ! Your are using the xrdp-installer script via ssh connection  !
  ! You might need to create your ~/.xsessionrc file manually    !
 
#? sudo apt install xfce4-session xubuntu-desktop
#? echo "exec plasma_session" >> ~/.xsession
# sudo apt remove xfce4-power-manager xfce4-screensaver 
```

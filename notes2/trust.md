> In the remainder of this section we brieﬂy explain
PolarityRank, a propagation algorithm introduced in
[13,14] to propagate positive and negative information
through a graph. Then, we present PolarityTrust, our trust
and reputation algorithm that adapts PolarityRank in order
to deal with the trust and reputation task, facing some
common vulnerabilities in TRS’s, such as the orchestrated
attacks and the dishonest votes [2].

> In fact, our goal is not an absolute measure of trust
for each node—rather, we wish to determine a measure of
trust from any node to any other. Another challenge: what
does it mean to combine distrusts through successive people
in a chain? One of the main contributions of our paper is to
address this situation. We try to develop an understanding
of appropriate models for the propagation of distrust (Sec-
tion 3.2.1 and Section 3.3). One of our findings is that even
a small amount of information about distrust (rather than
information about trust alone) can provide tangibly better
judgments about how much user i should trust user j.

Its just debris from the salt pellets that go into that tank, nothing to worry about there. Softener salt (which is what this is) isn't cleaned very much and this buildup is pretty normal.
Your fine to use the dishwasher when its asking for salt, there's no issue there, you just might notice some deposits on glassware if your water has high hardness or you don't use rinse agent.
Don't add anything other than salt to that tank like the other comment suggested, it won't help and cleaners will destroy the resin in the water softener in your dishwasher.
The salt melts/disolves in that tank, then its only used to regenerate the water softener resin media when needed, its not something added to the wash water itself.

You also don't need to find special "dishwasher salt" (somat and miele are bigger names, finish also makes "special salt") if its not readily available and cheap where you are, just don't use table salt as the additives can plug up the resin in the softener, but any water softener salt is fine, you just might need to break a rare larger piece up to fit in.
"Dishwasher salt" is stupid expensive and its marketing is worse than detergent, "5x power" etc... Its just salt, 100% sodium chloride, no additives or anything (there shouldn't be).
eg. Finish Dishwasher "Performance" salt is ~$25/kg... or sifto "CrystalPlus" softener salt is $8.99/20kg, or $0.45/kg)... Its the exact same thing, you just need to find a place to keep the bigger bag... We run the dishwasher every other day (large household) a bag will last at least a few years, where the boxes of Somat I was trying to find locally was only lasting a month or two a box.

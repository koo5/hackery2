    glitches in setup (ignoring parameters)
    weird idea about ignoring errors in pre/post run scripts
    difficult to read output
    ignored errors
    interrupted run causes subsequent runs to fail, requires manual cleanup

overall, i prefer btrfs, it's saner, at least for home/desktop use. Zfs may come with more robustness and functionality for bigger deployments.

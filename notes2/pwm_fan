12v 800ma max, but gets hot quickly at 12v 300ma
does not seem to care if only one of the two output pins is used (with motor to ground) and the other is left free, but free pin still heats up.
can only drive two motors, when both 0A and 1A are on, the outputs are off

probably works the same as L9110 but with higher voltage?





L293D
https://www.arduino.cc/documents/datasheets/H-bridge_motor_driver.PDF
This device is suitable for use in switching applications at frequencies up to 5 kHz.
max 36V
600mA OUTPUT CURRENT CAPABILITY PER CHANNEL (continuous)
1.2A PEAK OUTPUT CURRENT (non repetitive) PER CHANNEL
separate driving of each channel?

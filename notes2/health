Glad someone brought up radon. No one knows about it. Get a HRV or ERV and ideally slab depressurization, Google the terms if unfamiliar folks! Enjoy the diy projects haha

I still use melatonin on occasion. When I first learned about it, I tried the 10mg version, and it never did anything for me. Years ago I read about 0.3mg being the correct dose, and gave that a try. I don't take it every night, but when I do, I sleep much better, and for longer without waking up.

The main annoying thing about it is that you really need to take it a few hours before you go to sleep. So it's not something where you can realize that you're having trouble falling asleep, and take it only when needed. I have heard of some people where it does make them sleepy immediately after taking it, but I don't think that's a common reaction.

i'm only focusing on systems that work universally with any target language and are probably mainly written in python or are similarly non-hacky solutions

	"""
	The immediate predecessors to this pyWeb tool are FunnelWeb, noweb and nuweb. The ideas lifted from these other tools created the foundation for pyWeb.

	There are several Python-oriented literate programming tools. These include LEO, interscript, lpy, py2html, PyLit.
	"""

	pyWeb also specifically rejects some features of nuweb and FunnelWeb. These include the macro capability with parameter substitution, and multiple references to a chunk. These two capabilities can be used to grow object-like applications from non-object programming languages (e.g. C or Pascal). Since most modern languages (Python, Java, C++) are object-oriented, this macro capability is more of a problem than a help.

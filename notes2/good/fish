fish is a great interactive shell, but it refuses to be a scripting language: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/510
ridiculous indeed.


reload prompt:
```
. ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish
```
or:
```
exec fish
```


set path:
```
set -U fish_user_paths $fish_user_paths /home/koom/sw/node-v10.15.1-linux-x64/bin/ 
```

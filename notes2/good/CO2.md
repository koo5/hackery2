- The world health organisation recently updated its air quality guideline and does not recommend that the annual exposure to PM2.5 exceeds 5 μg/m³. However, the Vindriktning shows you a green light until 35 μg/m³ which is SEVEN TIMES the WHO air quality guideline.
- The Plantower PMS5003 is one of the best low cost PM2.5 sensors using the laser-scattering method and has been proven to have a good correlation and accuracy compared to reference instruments.

You need federated protocols. So Usenet, or Lemmy for Reddit-lookalikes. Notabug also does mutual replication with Lemmy IIRC.

At this stage, you’re almost inevitably going to find the front page of these alternatives filled with right-wing, or even alt-right, political content. If you’re fine with that, proceed; otherwise, you may have to stick with something mainstream for now, such as Reddit itself of maybe Quora, despite the censorship.

Good-ish Reddit alternatives include Saidit and Ruqqus. Voat has been an extremist echochamber for a long, long time now, so I’d stay away unless you yourself are a member of the alt-right. Ruqqus has a lot of promise because it has many of the same subs as Reddit; however, there’s still not much activity.

You have sites with Gab and Minds, which are either Twitter-esque or otherwise something unique from Reddit. Both have pretty far-right biases, and quite a few right-wing YouTubers you may have heard of, but the moderation is decent from what I’ve experienced.

 - needs schema

neo4j:
 - not a hypergraph, edges can have properties which are string keys/values, but not first-class

rdf:
so, lets say i want to store the kbdbg data from multiple runs of pyin.
it seems you either preemptively put each triple into its own (uniquely named) graph,  
and then refer to graphs instead of nodes, for example:
```frame1 has_rule rule7graphuuid15 frame1graphuuid14.```
or you dont use graphs for disambiguating your nodes,
```frame1uuid7 has_rule rule7uuid15 frame1graphuuid14.```
or you use blank nodes maybe? probably not a good idea

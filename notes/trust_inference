Trust inference, which is the mechanism to build new pair-wise
trustworthiness relationship based on the existing ones, is a funda-
mental integral part in many real applications, e.g., e-commerce,
social networks, peer-to-peer networks, etc. State-of-the-art trust
inference approaches mainly employ the transitivity property of
trust by propagating trust along connected users (a.k.a. trust prop-
agation), but largely ignore other important properties, e.g., prior
knowledge, multi-aspect, etc.
In this paper, we propose a multi-aspect trust inference model
by exploring an equally important property of trust, i.e., the multi-
aspect property. The heart of our method is to view the problem
as a recommendation problem, and hence opens the door to the
rich methodologies in the field of collaborative filtering. The pro-
posed multi-aspect model directly characterizes multiple latent fac-
tors for each trustor and trustee from the locally-generated trust
relationships. Moreover, we extend this model to incorporate the
prior knowledge as well as trust propagation to further improve in-
ference accuracy.

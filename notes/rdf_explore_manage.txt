		note:
			there is kind of a continuum starting from dealing with bare triples:
				strictly: management of graph and rdf-based data in a generic way
					Just nodes and edges:
						sw that deals with graphs in the mathematical sense, mostly represented by tools for "property graph" databases, ie, neo4j. Rdf is more expressive and can map to this only partially.
					sw aware of contexts(graphs):
						for example gruff.
					sw that includes special functionality for managing rdf lists (still in a non-domain-specific way).
						none found yet, but not so hard to add implement
					less common/new idioms:
						dealing with properties of graphs / properties of triples i ntelligently, understanding nested graphs/contexts
				less strictly:
					sw for managing domain-specific data, where rdf is largely just a storage mechanism, "templating systems".
				even less strictly, could be said: starting from freeform text, progressively adding stronger semantics, and not losing the implicit information hidden in the form...


		software, roughly ordered by immediate relevance:

			https://github.com/sebferre/sparklis
				CNL

			https://www.tomsawyer.com/graph-database-browser/
				recommended?
				viewing/explorations

			yED
				recommended, but probably chokes on 10k+ nodes
				https://www.yworks.com/products/yed/download#download
				automatic layouting
				how to export into it:
					we need to do it in a streaming fashion:

					pyyed:
						chokes on 1000+ triples
					best to save our stuff as graphml, that's a xml format comparable to graphviz's.
					https://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/file_details/graphml/prolog/graphml_ugraph.pl is no use because it only uses "ugraphs", undirected graphs
					maybe use networkx in python?

			allegro graph + gruff + agraph webview:
				recommended
				form-based editing, graph navigation, would be more useful if it understood rdf lists, but definitely has some merit
				Graphical SPARQL builder

			https://zeppelin.apache.org/
				recommended for exploration/visualizations?
				http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/usage/dynamic_form/intro.html
				https://hub.docker.com/r/cambridgesemantics/contrib-zeppelin/

			jupyter notebook
				"you can run SPARQL queries against AnzoGraph."


			mindmapping/mind-mapping sw potentially usable with rdf:
				meta:
					http://www.opensourcecreative.org/ep040/

				ordered from most promising to least:
					iMapping
						recommended
						https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKh6XY2DHS8
							"formality considered harmful"
						setevi-html
						http://xam.de/go/pkm/

					freeplane
						recommended
						seems to have a more freeform attitude, yet still keyboard friendly.
						i can definitely imagine this used for exploring rdf-based data (or a high-level, possibly domain-specific export of them)
						scriptable
						MapInsight
							https://freeplane.sourceforge.io/wiki/index.php/Add-ons_(install)
							https://github.com/adxsoft/MapInsight-Addon
						https://freeplane.sourceforge.io/wiki/index.php/Current_Freeplane_File_Format
						http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Import_and_export

					inforapid
						http://www.buildyourmap.com/
						many import formats
						rdf import, somewhat usable, but skips some nodes
						"build sitemap"
						"watch clipboard"

					https://www.thebrain.com/
						maybe useful for some creative mindmapping, but the navigation doesn't seem suited for factual work?

					"XMind: ZEN 2020"
						keyboard based navigation between nodes, so far the closest to what i'd want in a rdf viewer
						implicit "is-part-of" relation, other relations possible but not keyboard navigable

						"open source"(?..)

					"XMind 8 Pro"
						"open-source"(?..)

					https://mind42.com/
						basic, browser based, not sure if it supports "custom" links

					vym
						no "custom" links, even in latest version
						Qt (probably snappier than java)

					note
						an issue with all of them so for is a lack of automatic layouting for "non-primary" connections, ie, nodes are layouted by their "part-of" relationship, and you can choose different presentations of that, or move a child node into different slots of the parent node, but once you add a "custom" relation, you have to position it yourself. But we could tackle that.

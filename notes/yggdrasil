yggdrasil as a private vpn:

there is no fingerprint verification when nodes connect, therefore peer outernet ip's are not trustworthy.

there is no pubkey whitelisting when connecting to peers, therefore peer outernet ip's are not trustworthy.

there is no pubkey whitelisting with multicast discovery, therefore multicast must be disabled.

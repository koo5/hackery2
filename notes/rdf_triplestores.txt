		important factors:
			automatic rest api?

			non-rdf interfaces:

                    GraphQL to sparql and back, seems usable, recommended alternative to stardog's
                    - but no subscriptions

				stardog
				anzo
					OpenCypher
					sql: no
					inserting jsonld through python api

				neptune
					cypher
					? GraphQL:
						"If you're interested in enabling GraphQL for access to Amazon Neptune, there's an example application showing how to use AWS AppSync GraphQL and Amazon Neptune."
						???
					sql: no


		cool ones found so far:
				stardog
					- recommended
					- SQL: https://www.stardog.com/docs/#_sql_schema_mappings
					- GraphQL: "automagically provides a GraphQL endpoint over your existing RDF graphs"
					- virtual graphs
					- owl inference with explanations
					- no free version, no pricing
					
				allegro (+ gruff)
					- recommended, at least for gruff, but stardog has a lot more functionality useful for us
					
				https://terminusdb.com/
					versioning
		okay
			virtuoso
				URLBurner.
					could be used like this:
						create a django service to be accessed through a bookmarklet.
						service first submits a page to uriburner, then makes a request to add "x a bookmark; byUser koo"
						export from virtuoso, edit in protege?
						could be used to build a bookrmarking solution, but isn't one by itself, so far

		not so excited about:
			blazegraph
				crashes, ooms, poor performance (in my tests...)
            orientdb
                not a hypergraph
                    https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/4078

				"""
				The user can request a RDF store with forms (similar to classical SQL/MS Access forms) without any SPARQL knowledge.
				The user can navigate through the graph returned by the request guided by his imperious information needs....
				These forms are build by a knowledge engineer who knows SPARQL.
				Each form is based on SPARQL (with a little modification: each $variable will automatically generate a request form field).

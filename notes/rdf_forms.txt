	no shacl

	recommended?


https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms
	model driven form-based editing, useful as a framework for making rdf-stored data editable to users
	needs polishing, but recommended


TBCME/TBCSE/TBCFE
	recommended, but expensive
	TBCFE and TBCSE are discontinued editions
	TBCFE dosen't support SWP or anything
	template engine with sparql:

		https://www.topquadrant.com/technology/sparql-web-pages-swp/
	https://www.topquadrant.com/technology/graphql/
		seems buggy, can't even load a file
		many cool features: "We are planning to support syntax highlighted entry of SHACL Shapes in the next release (in addition to forms, etc.)."
		seems to be heavily aimed at editing ontologies in exactly-shaped forms rather than at working with arbitrary rdf data (can't even paste our data in)
	authors of http://datashapes.org/forms.html
		recommended
		SHACL
		only implemented in TBC?
		https://www.topquadrant.com/constraints-on-rdflists-using-shacl/
	https://uispin.org/
		not sure how is related to shacl, since spin is like a predecessor to shacl

	interesting, recommended
	https://cubicweb.readthedocs.io/en/default/book/devweb/edition/form/#webform
	web app framework, higher-level than django
	data format compatible with rdf (EAV)
	export into rdf
		https://www.cubicweb.org/link/1347429?vid=rdf
	nice community
	seems kinda overcomplicated?
	```
	(16:19:43) matrix: <nchauvat> instead of overcomplicated, I would say underdocumented :)
	(16:19:59) matrix: <nchauvat> documentation is the target of version 3.29
	(16:20:29) matrix: <nchauvat> and client-side views are in the works to replace cubicweb.web
	(16:20:37) matrix: <nchauvat> it should make things simpler
	(16:20:45) matrix: <nchauvat> hopefully
	```
	extension seems bitrotten a bit:

	editor, requires registration
	has a system of editable form templates
	probably only browsing strictly by these templates

	dead, needs maintenance, but seems well-developed, and works, and installation is fairly easy

	sonobus
		```But my problem with peer-to-peer programs such is Sonobus is another. That is that there is no synchronization between the users. Everyone hears something else depending on the ping times they see to the other users. If there are few users and they have very low ping times all will be well. But for bigger groups and more widely varying ping times that will make playing synchronization impossible as what one person hears as synchronous will not be what another hears as synchronous.```
		```The situation was similar to joining a Jamulus server with a very high ping time, anything over about 20ms ping and 40ms total connection latency is not good. So I run my own server over my home fiber-optic internet and that works great for me and my other band mates. If someone with a high-latency connection joins the server, it doesn't ruin the whole jam for me, where in Sonobus, that was the opposite of my experience, if someone with high latency joins it immediately ruins the session. Now granted I don't have a tone of experience just a couple hours of trial and error. But at this point Jamulus provides the better, more predictable experience.```
		```A for Sonobus I tested with my band mates because the audio quality seems better, you don't usually get pops and waverly sounds. The problem for us with Sonobus was latency. In my case I was hearing almost every member in different times, first guitar, then bass and finally the singer...It was difficult to play in time. We used PCM 16 quality audio to decrease in 5ms (roundtrip) the latency (decompression takes about 2.5ms). We live in the same town so I really did not understand why the experience was so bad. So happily we stick to Jamulus :).
		We also tested Sonobus because of routing options. If you use VST version every member can be mapped to a track in a DAW, so you can add FX (compression, deesser, eq...), this is very convenient if your intention is to stream a virtual gig, gives the person who is mixing more control over what and how is sent to the stream.```
		
		- so, this should be good for 1:1 teaching sessions, and not so good for collaborative jamming

		```I use Sonobus and JamKazam to jam with other people in public groups, the goal of the jam is just fun, I mean it's not very important what I play or with whom or the sync with other members (if I am in sync with a couple of members is ok for me). But only with Jamulus was possible to work on a real rehearsal almost as we were in the same room. I am running my own server and client in the same laptop (Lenovo T460) and it works pretty well.```
		
		- so, same as sonobus?
		
		
	jamulus
		```when using a stereo microphone and acoustic guitar. Jamulus seems to have trouble keeping the left and right channels time-aligned after dropouts resulting in what sounds like a constantly changing frequency response due to the phase shifts. Pluck a single string and just let it decay; repeat. The D or G string is best. Hopefully you'll hear what I'm describing. It sounds like the low frequencies "pop" in and out of a flat, full-spectrum response. This phase shifting can also be heard with client and server on the same box although with fewer dropouts it's harder to reproduce. It happens for me on Windows, Apple and Linux OSs.```
		```The best quality for Jamulus has less than 500kbs the 24 bit PCM is over 1.2Mbs. There is no way that Jamulus can keep up with that and there will be many users who have connections that can't keep up.
		Yes, Jamulus is looking to increase the quality in the future for those who can avail themselves of it. But at the moment the idea is to be as inclusive as possible.
		I also note that I have heard such things when using low and normal quality, but never with high.```
		
		- so, synchronization is there, but yea i do get the popping ..

		The NINJAM client records and streams synchronized intervals of music between participants. Just as the interval finishes recording, it begins playing on everyone else's client. So when you play through an interval, you're playing along with the previous interval of everybody else, and they're playing along with your previous interval. If this sounds pretty bizarre, it sort of is, until you get used to it, then it becomes pretty natural. In many ways, it can be more forgiving than a normal jam, because mistakes propagate differently.
		- so, this isnt for any kind of teaching sessions or somesuch

		Soundjack is a slightly different solution again, allowing both a server-client connection as well as peer-to-peer connections nominally for use within a LAN. The lag is eliminated as best as possible and you are able to communicate via text chat while you jam.

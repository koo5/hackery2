router - dealer
 - dealer blocks on HWM (in node in throws)

router - router 
- works when you set your id (socket setopt)
ZMQ_IDENTITY

 - then both sides drop when HWM



Since ZeroMQ v3.2 there’s a socket option you can set to catch this error: ZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY. Set that on the ROUTER socket and then when you provide an unroutable identity on a send call, the socket will signal an EHOSTUNREACH error.



Client-server pattern
Note: This pattern is still in draft state and thus might not be supported by the zeromq library you’re using!

zmq_bind (socket, "inproc://somename");

So, the main distinction to see is between the resources listed in these two files:

rdf_explore_manage.txt is about software that:
	* sees rdf as a method to encode graphs. There are graph visualizers.
	* allows you to explore rdf data in a tabular form. Subject predicate object columns, one row for each triple.
	* is like ontowiki, basically a readymade user application with a fixed-ish UI, and that just happens to use RDF underneath.
	* is specialized for editing RDFS/OWL ontologies

whereas rdf_forms.txt is about libraries that allow you to generate user interfaces for/from rdf data / generate user interfaces by writing rdf declarations

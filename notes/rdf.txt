		- use pure rdflib instead of cwm, rdflib is maintained
		- make sure list nodes don't appear in extra triples, and are well-formed
		- if you want something nested, it must be a bnode

		cwm: better to avoid in the beginning and use just rdflib, which keeps being developed.

The records are stored in several tables in a SQL Server database. Using Karma we modeled these tables in terms of the EDM ontology and converted the data into RDF. We are creating a 5-star Linked Data, linked to DBpedia, the Getty Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)® and the NY Times Linked Data."""

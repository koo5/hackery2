svelte sortable table

	https://sveltematerialui.com/demo/data-table/
		seems very nice, but doesn't play with snowpack
		works in build, only breaks in dev
		supposedly plays with vite though, which is weird

			hmh, i didnt have any isssues with css..
		
		
	https://smeltejs.com/components/data-tables
		looks usable, but not as polished
		snowpack maybe possible

	https://vincjo.fr/svelte-simple-datatables/
		has what seems as glitches in sorting arrows, but maybe it's intentional?

		Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getBoundingClientRect' of undefined
		```
		seems to be fixed by wrapping it with a <div>

		```
		Unhandled Runtime Error
		TypeError: th is undefined
		```
		what now?
		
	https://material-ui.com/components/tables/
		so what does it take to use the WebComponent (?) directly?

			vuetify project also looks impressive

	https://ivosdc.github.io/svelte-generic-crud-table/
		quite ok
	
	https://svelte-materialify.vercel.app/components/data-table/

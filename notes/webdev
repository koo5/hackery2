svelte sortable table

	see:
		https://github.com/koo5/esp-wifi-manager/tree/sortable_table_component_showdown

	maybe:

		https://material-ui.com/components/tables/
			so what does it take to use the WebComponent (?) directly?
			https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-web#2
			https://material-ui.com/
				...
				vuetify project also looks impressive
			
	the contenders:

		frameworks

			https://sveltematerialui.com/demo/data-table/
				seems very nice, but doesn't play with snowpack
				works in build, only breaks in dev
				supposedly plays with vite though, which is weird
				https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61970250/getting-svelte-material-ui-working-with-snowpack-and-sass
					hmh, i didnt have any isssues with css..
				
				
			https://smeltejs.com/components/data-tables
				looks usable, but not as polished
				issue
					https://github.com/matyunya/smelte/issues/235
				snowpack maybe possible
				https://github.com/matyunya/smelte/issues/193
					https://github.com/khanguyen88/smelte-typescript-snowpack
			

		one-offs
		
			https://vincjo.fr/svelte-simple-datatables/
				seems kinda usable, has nice search, but too many issues for now, it seems
				has what seems as glitches in sorting arrows, but maybe it's intentional?
				
				```
				Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getBoundingClientRect' of undefined
				```
				seems to be fixed by wrapping it with a <div>

				```
				Unhandled Runtime Error
				TypeError: th is undefined
				```
				- https://github.com/vincjo/svelte-simple-datatables/issues/26
				
				also: https://github.com/vincjo/svelte-simple-datatables/issues/21
				
				
			https://github.com/dasDaniel/svelte-table
				todo
				not very polished
				sorting works
			
			https://ivosdc.github.io/svelte-generic-crud-table/
				looks quite ok 
			
			https://github.com/mattiash/svelte-tablesort
				no pagination, just primitive sorting, but works!



	irrelevant

		https://svelte-materialify.vercel.app/components/data-table/
			apparently not complete yet?
			
		https://sveltestrap.js.org/?path=/story/components--table
			no sorting
		
		https://github.com/bsssshhhhhhh/svelte-data-grid
			no sorting(?)

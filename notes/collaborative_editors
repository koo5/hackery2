	looks more or less perfect, since there is a server too
	we'd posseibly just tweak the ui a bit.

### bytemd
	you have to `npm i` both in the example directory and in the root dir and possibly in the other example dir.
	still, the svelte component crashes the sapper server somehow (basically the server exits instead of starting up, no error given)
	probably can be followeed up with
	not too active but seems maintained + maybe big backer
	
	so...probably not a bad choice 
	


### etherpad
	git@github.com:ether/etherpad-lite-jquery-plugin.git
	simple iframe embeedding, if it can be made to be flexible wrt width/height, could work

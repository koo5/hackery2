force_update (Optional, boolean): If true, this option will force the frontend (usually Home Assistant) to create a state changed event when the sensor updates even if the value stayed the same. Some applications like Grafana require this when working with Home Assistant, but beware it can significantly increase the database size. Defaults to false.


filters (Optional): Specify filters to use for some basic transforming of values. See Sensor Filters for more information.


heartbeat

Send the value periodically with the specified time interval. If the sensor value changes during the interval the interval will not reset. The last value of the sensor will be sent.

So a value of 10s will cause the filter to output values every 10s regardless of the input values

^ but switch, etc, dont have filters

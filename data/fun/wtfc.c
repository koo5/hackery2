//I think c isn't verbose enough..well..it looks interesting. it has potential. go on. //i think if i get it working
//i'll enter it into ioccc
on Function Do
	Set the integer x to 1;
	Is x True? If so Then say("Hey") Otherwise say("Hello");
done

//preform the following statements
//        Set the string s to "Hello, World!";
//        Then say(s);
//        Then set x to 12;
//Unless x equals 1 Then In that Case end
                        
                        //this *could* work
Hmm im thinking about stuff like saying("Goodbye"); and running Function(); anyway bye

> We characterize our system as a Large Action Model, or LAM, emphasizing our commitment to better understand actions, specifically human intentions expressed through actions on computers, and, by extension, in the physical world.

our key observation is that the inherent structure of human-computer interactions differ from natural language or vision.The applications are expressed in a form that is more structured than a rasterized image, and more verbose and noisy than a sentence or paragraph. The characteristics we desire from a LAM are also different from a foundation model that understands language or vision alone: while we may want an intelligent chatbot to be creative, LAM-learned actions on applications should be highly regular, minimalistic (per Occam`s razor), stable, and explainable.

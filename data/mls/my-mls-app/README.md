a more complex example, where each client is represented by a svelte component, having an input and an output buffer (list of messages), and where the "Authentication Service" is represented by another visual component, and the main app component delivers queued messages one by one on a click, and the client components have buttons for the most crucial actions like starting a group, generating an epoch commit, etc, and the state of each group is in turn represented by another component owned by the client component

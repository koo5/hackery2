Oh man, RTFM... :) no but really, for this exact reason every single update_interval option in the docs has a "See Default Filter." link so that users can find out about this quicker. Closing...

Sensor Component
force_update
force_update (Optional, boolean): If true, this option will force the frontend (usually Home Assistant) to create a state changed event when the sensor updates even if the value stayed the same. Some applications like Grafana require this when working with Home Assistant, but beware it can significantly increase the database size. Defaults to false.
